          <h2 class="Head">Year of Cozy</h2>
          <p>I’m glad that themes don’t have to start on January 1st, because it’s taken me a bit more time to settle on mine, but I think I’ve finally got it. For most of my adult life, I have moved every year and switched jobs almost as frequently. I don’t regret that, but I think that part of my life is over. I have found a place to live that I love and I have a job that I enjoy and, more importantly, I genuinely feel that the work is valuable and meaningful. So now, I just want to get Cozy.</p>
          <p>I have lots of ideas for projects and aspects of my life that fall under Year of Cozy. I want to make this house considerably more homey - hang curtains for once, get a rug, invest in a good mattress, etc. I have a yard now too and I’m looking forward to sprucing it up and doing some gardening. I also have an office now, and I plan on having this job long enough that it makes sense to add some personal touches and invest in that space as well. There are also some personal relationship and financial goals, specifically future-planning finances (because existential dread is definitively Not Cozy) but those are a bit too personal to go into here.</p>
          <p>For a while I felt like the Year of Cozy wasn’t enough of a theme. Hearing about grand themes like Year of the Voyage, Year of the Forge, Year of the Phoenix, etc. made my little theme seem awfully quaint. But I keep coming back to the word Cozy and I think it’s what I really want to focus on, as mundane as it might be.</p>
