# 02 Civil rebellions and tribal uprisings
The revolt of 1857 which started on 11th May 1857 to 8 May 1858 was a dramatic instance of traditional struggle against foreign rule but it was no sudden occurrence it was the culmination of a century-long tradition of opposition to British domination.

There establishment of British power in India was a piecemeal operation this process produce discontent resentment and resistance at every stage. Thus, resistance Took place in three forms: civil rebellions, tribal uprisings, and peasant movements.

The major cause of all civil rebellions and other uprisings were the rapid changes the British introduced in the economy, administration, and land revenue systems. These changes lead to the destruction of an aggregation society causing many deposed Rajas and Nawabs or their descendants to uprooted and impoverished zamindars landlords and poligars and ex-retailers and officials of conquered Indian states. The backbone of these rebellions came from Indebted peasants who ruined art and demobilised soldiers.

The Zamindars joined these uprisings and rebellions because they lost control over their lands in revenues due to the extinction of their rights or forceful sale of the rights to the British. the proud zamindars resented this loss. Thus with personal scores to Settle with the new rulers, they joined and started uprisings and rebellions.

peasants and artisans had their reasons to take up the arms against the increasing land revenues forced a large number of peasants to grow indebted. The new landlords pushed up rents the economic decline of the peasantry was reflected in the 12th major and numerous minor famines from 1772 and 1857.

The new court and legal systems gave a fillip to the dispossessers of land and encouraged the rich to oppress the poor. The corruption grew to unparalleled heights. the police in the words of William Edwards Became a “ scourge to the people”.

The ruin of handicraft industries as a result of the imposition of free trade in India and the levy of discriminatory tariffs against Indian goods in Britain pauperized millions of artisans.

another major cause of rebellions was the very foreign character of the British rule like any other people the Indian people too felt humiliated at being under foreigners' heel. this feeling of heart of pride inspired efforts to expel the foreigners

The civil rebellions began in Bengal and Bihar. from 1763 to 1856 there was hardly a year without an operation or a decade without a major armed rebellion in one part of the country or the other there are more than 40 major rebellions apart from thousand minor ones.

These almost continuous rebellions were massive in their totality but were wholly local as they were the causes of local and isolated grievances therefore their effects were also localised they offer more the same character not because they represented the nation but because they presented the common conditions which were the Indians were put in by the British

The resistance represented no social alternative it was centuries old in form and ideological and cultural content its basic objective was to restore earlier forms of rule and social relations

The British were able to pacify the rebellions one by one they give concessions to the less fiery rebel chiefs and Zamindar in form of reinstatement the restoration of the re-states and the reduction in revenue assessment so long as they agreed to leave peaceful under their authority the more fiery ones were quickly annihilated. [[Dewan Velu Thampi of Travancore]] was for example publicly hanged

The suppression of the civil rebellion was a major reason Why the revolt of 1857 did not spread to South West and eastern India yet these civil uprising established a strong invaluable local tradition among the people to oppose British rule the Indian people would later draw inspiration from this traditions in the later nationalist struggle

The tribal people who were spread over a large part of India organised hundred of militant outbreaks and insurrections in the 19th century this uprisings were marked by immense courage and sacrifice and lots of pression and veritable butchery. This was caused due to colonial interaction with the tribals which brought them fully within the ambit of colonialism .it recognized their tribal chiefs zamindars and introduced a new system of land revenue and taxation it encouraged influx of Christian missionaries in the tribal lands and the tribal people were later exploited for their crops by the British and they were rack-rented on their own lands

The colonial Lizum also changed the tribal peoples relationship with forest before they saw forest as a place which is the good demand for food and shelter after the colonial government came it changed all of it . It usurped the forest lands end the village common land eight refused to let cultivation shift to new areas

The government officials intensified and expanded the system of [[Begar]].
