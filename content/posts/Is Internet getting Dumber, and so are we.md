I have been browsing the internet since the days when [The Talking Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Tom_%26_Friends#Talking_Tom) and [GANGNAM STYLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) was the hype

#### How did I start?

I started watching the series of [Talking Tom & Friends](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DBcdm4eKchvBWCHzmkuE_WSXgPaS1Mn), Then somehow due to one of the recommendations I hopped to Cyanex.

Then from gaming, I jumped from reaction videos and vice versa.

**This was all before the algorithm of youtube was introduced.**

Today, when I use Youtube I only find things I have already known/watched about, I feel the need to constantly delete my YouTube Data held by Google, to get videos about the topic I scarcely know about, after all, that’s what led me to where I am, **The constant surge of interesting videos which made me think.**, But these days with the algorithms we can’t expect this, we are fed the same types of things again and again

You can see this in my friend's Instagram feed as well

His statements regarding his feed

>I scarcely use Instagram for reels now, When I first made my account I followed various tech YouTubers and Hashtags, Now even after following various anime accounts my feed isn’t changing,

### “I feel like I’m trapped in a box, forced to watch iPhone unboxing videos and Tech tips videos on Youtube, While what I really wanna watch is about Naruto and other new topics”

#### — My friend about his low Instagram usage.

This is not just a fact for youtube and Instagram, it’s true for Google, Twitter, Tiktok etc, we are increasingly getting fed the same homogeneous content on every platform.

### Tiktok

I feel TikTok is making people dumber, Have you ever felt “Why I am doing this? What am I getting out of this? Why am I even watching this?” after scrolling hundreds are TikToks for 15 to 20 minutes straight.?

Have you started studying only to feel you cannot concentrate and pick up the phone to watch tiktoks, somehow an hour or two passed and now what is the need to study.

You can see 6-7-year-old **kids** watching TikToks, not playing with Mom and Dad. The [timespan of people’s attention is decreasing](https://www.euruni.edu/blog/the-truth-about-decreasing-attention-spans-in-university-students/), and we as a population are getting dumber trying to chase the “Quick Fix” from that one Tiktok.
