I have been browsing internet since the days when [The Talking Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Tom_%26_Friends#Talking_Tom), and [GANGNAM STYLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) was the hype

#### How I started?
I started watching the series of [Talking Tom & Friends](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DBcdm4eKchvBWCHzmkuE_WSXgPaS1Mn), Then some how due to one of the recommedation I hopped to Cyanex .

Then from gaming I jumped from reaction videos and vice versa.

**This was all before the algorithm of youtube was introduced.**

Today, when I use Youtube I only find things I have already know/watched about, I feel the need to constantly delete my YouTube Data held by google, so as to get videos about topic I scarcely know about, 
after all that's what led me to where I am, **The constant surge of interesting videos which made me think.**,

I can see this in my Instagram feed as well






I was curious so, I opened an incognito tab and replicated as best I could the same history I had as a child.

#### Findings
After watching the first and second season, I checked My YouTube homepage, all I could find were Talking tom and angela videos
