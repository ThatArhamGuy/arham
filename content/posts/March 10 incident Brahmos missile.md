On March 10 2020 to various science work hard alarming the entering of some kind of missile in the Pakistani airspace.

It was in fact [BrahMos](/posts/brahMos) missile co-developed by India and Russia with almost 60% of manufacturing done in India which is now going towards 90% so as to promote the make in India policy of the NDA government.

Although the official statement says that the missiles launch and strike was a glitch in the system or a mistake done on the part of Indian military many suspect that it was a attempt to try and see how efficient and effective the Air defence systems of Pakistan.
