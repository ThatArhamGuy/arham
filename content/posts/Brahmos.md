# BrahMos

Brahmos is a medium ramjet supersonic missile Ko develop by India and Russia. Its name is derived from the names of two rivers in India and Russia namely the Brahmaputra and the Moskva. It is notably one of the fastest supersonic missiles in the world it is based on P – 800 onyx missile of the Russian military.

## Development

Developed as a joint venture between the defence research and development of India and Unitary Enterprise NPO Mashinostroyenia (NPOM) of Russia, in the name of BrahMos Aerospace. 50.5% of total shares of the Brahmos Aerospace is owned by India and 49.5% of shares are owned by Russia. The missile has been Falguni testing since 2004 with launches in Pokhran in which mark 2.8 capacity was seen and launch from sea

Many Brahmos variants are also being developed including a Brahmos II As well another variant named Brahmos – NG is also currently in Development which is reportedly to have AI capabilities

While the land and naval versions of BrahMos
can carry 200 kg warhead, its aerial version
is capable of delivering 300 kg warhead.

This capability of BrahMos is offering the challenge of nuclear deterrence to China and Pakistan,Against which they do not have any formidable response today.

## Significance

Is significant in a way that it is a close competitor to the Chinese ballistic missiles. Brahmos can be fired at supersonic speeds which also Prevents it from being Intercepted from enemy missiles. The Hypersonic variant of Brahmos which is currently under development is reportedly two flights speed is above all at market which will make it even harder for animal missiles and guns to intercept our missiles and take them down. With mass production of this Brahmos missiles India Will pose a message thread to the other significant power in the Southeast Asia, China.

Being one of the most powerful and effective missiles produced in Southeast Asia it has become bargaining chip for Indian diplomacy to be used for diplomatic missions around the Southeast Asian countries reportedly Philippines have expressed an interest in acquiring Brahmos missiles for their own navy. Vietnam Indonesia and Thailand have also stated interest in acquiring Brahmos missiles.

in line with the policy of make in India of the current NDA government the BrahMos' production went from 60% of parts produced in India to 90% of parts produced in India and most of the software for the missile was developed by India

It is expected by several defence experts that in future many nations threatened by Chinese belligerence will induct BrahMos. As Awais to safeguard themselves from the Chinese government, This will increase the power dynamics in favour of India in the In Indo-Pacific Region.
