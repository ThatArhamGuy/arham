On the morning of 11 May 1857. A band of sepoys from Meerut, crossed the Jamuna and set the toll house on fire and marched to the red Fort. Where they proclaimed Bahadur Shah, as the Shahenshah-e-Hindustan. This effort by the sepoys marked the start of the revolt of 1857 which was an unsuccessful but a heroic effort to drive out the foreigners from India the capture of Delhi and proclamation of Baadusha gave positive meaning to this revolt and provided a rallying point for the rebels in the imperial city.

This was only a precursor it followed a widespread mutiny by sepoys and rebellion almost all over north India. half of company sepoys (232224/2 = 116112) became rebels and acted against the company.

But even before the Meerut incident there were ramblings of the revolt because of the introduction of Enfield rifle, many incidents took place in which people defied the British and didnâ€™t use Enfield rifle one of these examples I am Shiv boy of 34 native infantry Mangal Pandey went a step further and fired at the sergeant major of his regiment he was a power over and executed and his regiment to what is the spend it the seventh Oudh regiment met a same fate.

Within a month of the capture of Delhi the revolt had spread to many other cities of India like Kanpur, Lucknow, Benares, Allahabad etc.  The rebel activity was marked by intense Anti-British feelings and the administration was toppled.
