> "The sun never set on the British Empire"

This was the saying for the European Empire of 18th-20th centaury. But in todays time the question emerges "Is Europe (By extension the Whole European Union) a Colony of the USA?". This Question has emerged after the [[Russian-Ukraine Crisis]].

These days international Geopolitics is Open and Liberal World Order. Meaning
- Democracy
- Freedom of Navigation
- Free Trade
These principles were developed and publicised by the USA, these keep the EU under USA's Protection and keeps the [[Hegemony]] of the USA over the [[Eurasian Region]]. This has kept the European rivalries at bay and prevented a World War.

Before the [[World War 2]], Europe was regarded as the "Violence Exporter of the world". But after the 'Self-Destruction' in World War 2 Europe adopted the *ideology of peace*. This made the USA used economic, diplomatic and military forces to end Europe's internal competition.

Before WW2, these were the superpowers of the world.
- Great Britain
- France
- Germany
- USSR
- Japan
- USA

But after the war USA was the only superpower left, this is due to the destruction of production equipment of the other country and their proximity to the epicenter of the war. USA's Population was also saved from the Air Raids, Bombardments, Concentration Camps and Deportations. USA emerged with 50% of the World's GDP after the war and it was the only country which could control and unite Europe.

#### Truman Doctrine
Launched in 1945, this doctrine pressured the European powers to free up their colonies. **Economic Aid** under the [[Marshall Plan]]. **Pro-Washington Institutes** were supported. The [[European Union]], [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations]], [[International Court of Justice]] etc. were also established. [[NATO]] was also organized against the [[Warsaw Pact]]. this made the EU dependent on USA through Article 5 which provides that
> if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked

This was done not only to counter the Soviets' but also to increase trade, and unify the European countries
